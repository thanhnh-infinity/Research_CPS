HOW TO MODEL REQUIREMENTS
=========================
It appears that the needs for the specification of requirements
vary depending on the type of analysis performed. In certain cases,
e.g. F.3-F.6 from the CPS Framework document (page 253 and following),
each concern is associated with a list of requirements, all of which
need to be satisfied for the concern to be satisfied.

In order instances, e.g. in the case studies from our recent papers [1,2],
a concern may be satisfied by different combinations of requirements,
whose representation appears, in the general case, to require the full 
extent of Boolean or 3-valued logical formulas over expressions stating
whether a certain requirement is satisfied/enforced.

Additionally, the same sources indicate the need for ways to explicitly
model how certain combinations of requirements may have the side-effect
of inhibiting the satisfaction of concerns.

It should be noted that the case studies from our recent papers [1,2]
also point out the need to reason about how a CPS may evolve over time
during its interaction with the domain, in terms of the effects of this
interaction on the attributes distilled by the CPS Model.

For these reasons, we choose to represent the links between requirements
and concerns by means of state constraints for language AL [3] (essentially,
causal laws describing the influence of the truth value of a Boolean
conjunction of possibly negated attributes on the truth value of another 
attribute), augmented by default statements (saying that an attribute
should be considered true/false unless otherwise concluded) and assumptions
(saying that an attribute should be assumed true/false in the initial
state of the domain). More specifically, and using the terminology of AL, 
the fact that a requirement r is satisfied is represented by a fluent 
sat(r). Similarly, for a concern c we introduce fluent sat(c,f), where
f is the function (in the sense of functional decomposition, e.g.
use case u1) where c is satisfied. A link between a certain combination of 
requirements to the satisfaction of a concern will thus be encoded by a 
state constraint whose body is a list of possibly negated fluents of the 
form sat(r) and whose head is of the form sat(c,f). We expect that, in 
complex situations, requirements may influence each other, i.e. be mutually 
exclusive. Our representation can easily capture these cases by means of
state constraints with a suitable body and with a head of the form -sat(r), 
where "-" denotes negation and r is the requirement whose satisfaction is 
prevented by the requirements listed in the body. If needed for modeling 
purposes, assumptions that requirements are satisfied or unsatisfied unless 
contrary evidence is available can be represented by means of default 
statements of AL.

If needed, these statements can be encoded in an OWL ontology. Additionally,
the definition of their semantics makes it possible to integrate them
seamlessly with statements about the effects of actions or events on
the domain of the CPS or on the CPS itself, thus allowing to incorporate
them into a model of the evolution of the CPS over time.

Simpler specifications, where each concern is associated with a list of 
requirements, all of which need to be satisfied for the concern to be satisfied, will be translated to state constraints either manually or
through some automated procedure.


HOW TO MODEL CONCERNS
=====================
As we stated above, the fact that a concern is satisfied is modeled by
a fluent of the form sat(c,f). It has been observed that concerns that are 
not addressed by any requirement should be considered not satisfied. This 
can be modeled by means of defaults of AL stating that, for every such 
concern c and function f, -sat(c,f) should hold by default.

Additionally, concerns are related to levels of functional decomposition.
For details on this and on their representation, please refer to a
separate document.

Summarizing the satisfaction of a concern w.r.t. on its sub-concerns
is modeled according to the following principle:

A concern (in a given function f, e.g. use case u1) is satisfied 
if-and-only-if:
1. it has at least one relevant sub-concern or requirement
2. every relevant sub-concern is satisfied
3. there is no evidence that the concern is otherwise unsatisfied


REVISION 1
==========
Let us assume that a state constraint says that, if requirement r1
is satisfied/implemented, then the security concern in use case u1 is
satisfied. According to the formalization proposed above, the state
constraint is:
	sat(security,u1) if sat(r1).
Let us suppose, however, that some requirement r2 has the side-effect
of impacting security negatively in u1. The corresponding state constraint
is:
	-sat(security,u1) if sat(r2).
If both requirements are satisfied, this causes inconsistency of the
specification. On the other hand, intuitively one would likely conclude
that security is not satisfied or, in more advanced instances, that it
is unknown whether it is satisfied, or yet again that security is less
likely to be satisfied.


REVISED FORMALIZATION V1
========================
In the state constraints formalizing the links between requirements and
concerns, the head of the state constraint is a fluent
	impacted(C,F,M)
where C is a concern, F is a function, and M is a mode, namely pos or neg.

CASE 1: this is the simplest case, where concerns default to unsatisfied

A concern (in a given function f, e.g. use case u1) is satisfied if:
  1. it is impacted by no combination of requirements and
  2. every relevant sub-concern is satisfied
OR
  1. it is impacted positively by at least one requirement combination and
  2. it is not impacted negatively by any combination of requirements and
  3. every relevant sub-concern is satisfied

A concern is unsatisfied in all other cases.



CASE 2: this is a more advanced case, where the satisfaction status of a
        concern may remain unknown/undecided/uncertain

A concern (in a given function f, e.g. use case u1) is satisfied if:
  1. it is impacted by no combination of requirements and
  2. every relevant sub-concern is satisfied
OR
  1. it is impacted positively by at least one requirement combination and
  2. it is not impacted negatively by any combination of requirements and
  3. every relevant sub-concern is satisfied

A concern is unsatisfied if:
  1. it is impacted negatively by at least one requirement combination and
  2. it is not impacted positively by any combination of requirements
OR
  1. it has no relevant sub-concern, and
  2. it is not impacted positively by any combination of requirements
OR
  1. it has a relevant sub-concern that is unsatisfied

The satisfaction status of a concern is unknown in all other cases.



REVISED FORMALIZATION V2
========================
Revised formalization v1 does not work well for concerns that
have no requirements and no relevant sub-concerns. Intuition
tells us that the concern is not satisfied. However, revised
formalization v1 concludes that the concern is satisfied.

Revised formalization v2 solves this problem. See item #2
in the first group of conditions for both case 1 and case 2.

In the state constraints formalizing the links between requirements and
concerns, the head of the state constraint is a fluent
	impacted(C,F,M)
where C is a concern, F is a function, and M is a mode, namely pos or neg.

CASE 1: this is the simplest case, where concerns default to unsatisfied

A concern (in a given function f, e.g. use case u1) is satisfied if:
  1. it is impacted by no combination of requirements and
  2. it has at least one relevant sub-concern and
  3. every relevant sub-concern is satisfied
OR
  1. it is impacted positively by at least one requirement combination and
  2. it is not impacted negatively by any combination of requirements and
  3. every relevant sub-concern is satisfied

A concern is unsatisfied in all other cases.



CASE 2: this is a more advanced case, where the satisfaction status of a
        concern may remain unknown/undecided/uncertain

A concern (in a given function f, e.g. use case u1) is satisfied if:
  1. it is impacted by no combination of requirements and
  2. it has at least one relevant sub-concern and
  3. every relevant sub-concern is satisfied
OR
  1. it is impacted positively by at least one requirement combination and
  2. it is not impacted negatively by any combination of requirements and
  3. every relevant sub-concern is satisfied

A concern is unsatisfied if:
  1. it is impacted negatively by at least one requirement combination and
  2. it is not impacted positively by any combination of requirements
OR
  1. it has no relevant sub-concern, and
  2. it is not impacted positively by any combination of requirements
OR
  1. it has a relevant sub-concern that is unsatisfied

The satisfaction status of a concern is unknown in all other cases.



REVISED FORMALIZATION V3
========================
Revised formalization v2 does not fully detect the uncertainty
about the satisfaction of concerns in case 2. Consider group 
of conditions:

  A concern is unsatisfied if:

    1. it has a relevant sub-concern that is unsatisfied

Suppose a concern has a relevant sub-concern that is unsatisfied,
but also a requirement that is satisfied. Revised formalization
v2 will conclude that the concern is unsatisfied. However,
intuitively, we would like to conclude that the satisfaction
status of the concern is unknown.

Revised formalization v3 solves this problem by introducing the
notion of positive and negative influence. We also rename
the types of inference for clarity and add optimistic inference.

BACKGROUND NOTIONS
In the state constraints formalizing the links between requirements and
concerns, the head of the state constraint is a fluent
	impacted(C,F,M)
where C is a concern, F is a function, and M is a mode, namely pos or neg.

A concern is positively influenced if:
1. a combination of requirements impacts it positively OR
2. a relevant sub-concern is satisfied

A concern is negatively influenced if:
1. a combination of requirements impacts it negatively OR
2. a relevant sub-concern is unsatisfied

A concern is affected by uncertain influence (from its sub-concerns) if:
1. a relevant sub-concern has unknown satisfaction

PESSIMISTIC INFERENCE ON CONCERN SATISFACTION
This is the simplest case, where concerns default to unsatisfied.

A concern (in a given function f, e.g. use case u1) is satisfied if:
  1. it is positively influenced AND
  2. it is not negatively influenced

A concern is unsatisfied in all other cases.


SKEPTICAL INFERENCE ON CONCERN SATISFACTION
This is a more advanced case, where the satisfaction status of a
concern may remain unknown/undecided/uncertain.

A concern (in a given function f, e.g. use case u1) is satisfied if:
  1. it is positively influenced AND
  2. it is not negatively influenced AND
  3. is not affected by uncertain influence

A concern is unsatisfied if:
  1. it is negatively influenced AND
  2. it is not positively influenced AND
  3. is not affected by uncertain influence
OR
  1. it has no relevant sub-concerns AND
  2. it is not positively influenced AND
  3. it is not negatively influenced

The satisfaction status of a concern is unknown in all other cases.

Intuition of "unknown satisfaction status": if we were to measure
satisfaction and unsatisfaction quantitatively and were to combine
influences from different sources, the result might be positive,
although it might be negative as well.


OPTIMISTIC INFERENCE ON CONCERN SATISFACTION
This is another simple case, where concerns default to unsatisfied,
but concerns that have no requirements nor sub-concerns are vacuously
satisfied.

A concern (in a given function f, e.g. use case u1) is satisfied if:
  1. it is positively influenced AND
  2. it is not negatively influenced
OR
  1. it has no relevant sub-concerns AND
  2. it is not positively influenced AND
  3. it is not negatively influenced

A concern is unsatisfied in all other cases.
